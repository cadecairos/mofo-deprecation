# mofo-deprecation
> a generic static page to signal a deprecated service

`mofo-deprecation` is a generic static page that we point URLs
of deprecated services to.

## Up and Running

`mofo-deprecation` is a static site: just open `index.html` in a browser.
[`makerstrap`](https://github.com/mozilla/makerstrap) is included
via [Bower](http://bower.io/), but the `bower_components` directory
has been included here to make deployment simple.
